# Tram MQTT

* Generate frames for multiple vehicles with random data (at least for the number of passengers) respecting the input data. The information must be retrieved from a configuration file.

## Installation

* python3

## Utilisation

* Run `python3 Client.py` to launch the client

* On an other terminal, run `python3 TP1.py` to launch the application and publish message on the topic -> we can see the trace of the received message on the first terminal

* The configuration file is `data.json`

* To add a vehicle, simply add it to data.json with an ID that does not already exist
